# Lost and Found Tracker

A clean and modern **web application** built with **Go (Golang)** to help users post, manage, and browse **lost and found items** with ease.  
It’s a lightweight, self-contained project using **HTML templates**, **CSS styling**, and a **SQLite database** for persistent storage.

## Features

- **Post Items** – Users can add lost or found items with details (title, description, contact, image, etc.)

- **Edit & Update** – Modify item details directly via the edit page.
- **Mark as Found** – Track when a lost item has been successfully found.
